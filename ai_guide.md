# Manual: Using AI for Legal Research

This guide explains how to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT) for legal researchâ€”particularly in fields like immigration, administrative, and human rights lawâ€”effectively and responsibly. It helps ensure that your research remains accurate, verifiable, and based on legitimate legal sources while avoiding errors or fabricated information (known as hallucinations).

Law is a complex discipline. Using AI can make it far more accessible by allowing you to explore subjects that might otherwise seem difficult to approach.

## 1. Define the Problem Clearly

Begin by clearly identifying your **legal question** and the **relevant jurisdiction**. For example: *â€œRefusal of residence card for EU family members in Estonia.â€*

Search trusted databases such as:
- **EUR-Lex** (EU legislation and directives)
- **Curia** (Court of Justice of the EU case law)
- **National court or ombudsman websites**
- **Academic or NGO databases** (e.g., ADDE, Meijers Committee)

AI tools can assist in locating specific documents even if you do not know their titles or publication dates. However, keep in mind that AI models have a **knowledge cutoff date**. If web access is available, results may still be limited by language, source type, or publication age. Alternate between broad and specific searches to cover topics such as:

- Administrative law
- Immigration law
- Human rights law
- Procedural law
- Constitutional law

## 2. Download and Assess Sources

Download relevant legislation, judgments, and reports as **text or PDF** files. If the files are scanned, convert them using OCR software. Plain text formats (e.g., .txt or .md) are preferable because they are lighter and easier for AI tools to process.

Ask the AI to:
- Summarize each document in simple terms.
- Confirm whether the document addresses your specific issue.
- Exclude materials that are irrelevant or redundant.

Retain the original documents for verification. You may instruct the AI to cross-check summaries against complete texts to ensure accuracy.

## 3. Upload Reliable Materials

Upload the verified files to your AI platform so it can reference authentic texts directly. Alternate between using summaries and full documents to balance detail and efficiency.

---

## 4. Repeat and Refine Searches

Continue the searchâ€“downloadâ€“verification cycle until new searches no longer yield additional relevant information. When sources and reasoning begin to overlap, your dataset is likely complete.

---

## 5. Conduct Deep Research Queries

Once your document collection is ready, submit focused research questions to the AI, for example:
- *â€œSummarize the legal reasoning behind the refusal of residence rights for EU family members.â€*
- *â€œCompare how Estonia and Latvia apply Article 5 of Directive 2004/38/EC.â€*

Ask the AI to **quote or reference specific uploaded materials** in its responses to ensure traceability.

---

## 6. Use and Verify the Findings

Apply your verified results to:
- Draft legal arguments, analyses, or complaints.
- Prepare comparative studies.
- Compile evidence bundles or background reports.

Always verify all citations and quotations against the original legal sources before relying on them.

---

## 7. Trust but Verify

AI serves as a rapid research assistantâ€”but it is **not a legal authority**. Always confirm critical points through official sources, reliable databases, or expert review before including them in formal documents or arguments.

## 8. Hallucinations and How to Prevent Them

A **hallucination** occurs when an AI system generates information that appears correct but is false or unsupported by any authentic source. This can include fictitious case names, incorrect citations, or inaccurate interpretations of law. Since AI models do not have direct access to external databases, they can unintentionally produce such errors.

AI reliability also decreases when its **context window**â€”the internal memory limit for processing textâ€”is exceeded. Long conversations or large document uploads can reduce precision. To maintain accuracy, summarize longer materials, divide them into smaller sections, and restate key details when necessary.

**To prevent hallucinations:**
- Formulate clear, specific legal questions and use verified, official sources.
- Work primarily with uploaded documents rather than general web summaries.
- Remove irrelevant or outdated data from your collection.
- Cross-check results across multiple authoritative sources.
- Require the AI to quote or cite directly from provided materials.
- Confirm all outputs manually or by consulting official databases.

By following these steps, your AI-assisted research remains **anchored in authentic legal texts**, ensuring reliability, transparency, and professional integrity.
