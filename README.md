# EU Directive 2004/38/EC Rights Guides

## Purpose and scope

This repository assembles non-commercial, community-maintained guides that help EU citizens and their family members understand and enforce their rights under **Directive 2004/38/EC** (the *Free Movement Directive* or *Citizens’ Rights Directive*). The Directive implements Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 45 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, recognising the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the EU ([European Commission – Free movement and residence](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=All%20EU%20citizens%20and%20their,EU%20Charter%20of%20Fundamental%20Rights)). It sets out:

- the right of EU citizens to reside in another EU country for **up to three months** without any conditions other than holding a valid passport or ID card ([European Commission – Short stays](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=All%20EU%20citizens%20and%20their,EU%20Charter%20of%20Fundamental%20Rights));
- conditions for stays **longer than three months**, which differ depending on whether the person is a worker, self-employed, student or economically inactive ([European Commission – Conditions for longer stays](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=,to%20comply%20with%20administrative%20formalities));
- the right to **permanent residence** after legally residing for five continuous years ([European Commission – Permanent residence](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=,there%20continuously%20for%20five%20years));
- rights of **family members** (both EU and non-EU nationals) to accompany or join EU citizens, subject to certain formalities ([European Commission – Family members](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=,They%20may%20be%20asked%20to)).

These guides are *informal self-help resources*. They cannot replace professional legal advice and are provided without any guarantee of completeness or accuracy. Users remain responsible for checking the latest legislation and seeking qualified counsel when needed.

### Authority Escalation Guide

The first guide in this repository, [Authority Escalation Guide](https://github.com/eudirective/guides/blob/63c606179faf9642255cb55063cc61046832ff1b/authority_escalation_guide.md), outlines how to handle situations where authorities fail to implement Directive 2004/38/EC correctly. It covers when and how to remind officials of deadlines, request clarification, file internal complaints, and pursue escalation through national oversight bodies, the EU Commission, SOLVIT or courts. The document stresses the importance of maintaining a paper trail, citing legal bases, and keeping communications professional. It also provides practical considerations such as freedom of information requests, interim measures and strategic use of EU-level mechanisms. **This guide is not legal advice; it is intended as a starting point for researching your options.**

## Planned expansions

The scope of the Directive is broad, and this repository aims to grow accordingly. Future guides may include:

- **Residence documents and registration** – eligibility and procedures for residence certificates, residence cards and registration certificates.
- **Permanent residence** – conditions and application processes for obtaining the right of permanent residence after five years ([European Commission – Permanent residence](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=,there%20continuously%20for%20five%20years)).
- **Family reunification** – rights and obligations for spouses, registered partners, children and dependent relatives ([European Commission – Family members](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=,They%20may%20be%20asked%20to)), including documentation and procedural steps.
- **Country-specific implementation** – summaries of how each Member State transposes the Directive, notable national practices and contact details of competent authorities.
- **Appeals and complaint procedures** – guidance on national appeal routes, SOLVIT, petitions to the European Parliament and complaints to the European Commission.
- **Case-law summaries** – brief analyses of Court of Justice of the European Union judgments interpreting Directive 2004/38/EC and related legislation.
- **AI guides** – guides on how to use AI workflows and custom GPTs to individualise letters, complaints, and research, and AI usage guides for non-technical users and contributors.
- **Frequently asked questions** – answers to common scenarios (e.g., proof of residence, recognition of partnerships, rights of students, health insurance requirements).

## How to use these guides

These guides provide practical checklists, explanations of legal concepts and references to official sources. They are meant to be read alongside official EU guidance such as the *Guide to free movement* and national information portals. When using these documents:

1. **Verify with official sources** – always consult the latest version of the Directive, national legislation and authoritative EU communications. For example, the European Commission explains that EU citizens may stay in another Member State for up to three months without requirements and outlines conditions for longer stays ([European Commission – Stays](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=,to%20comply%20with%20administrative%20formalities)).
2. **Check national implementation** – Member States may require specific formalities (e.g., registration within a certain period). Country-specific differences will be documented in future guides.
3. **Seek professional advice** – if your situation involves complex legal issues, consult a lawyer or professional service. The Commission recommends contacting national courts or SOLVIT if you believe your rights have been violated ([European Commission – Remedies and SOLVIT](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/democracy-eu-citizenship-anti-corruption/free-movement-and-residence_en#:~\:text=If%20you%20think%20that%20your,authorities%20if%20you%20encounter%20difficulties)).
