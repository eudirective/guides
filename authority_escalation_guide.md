## Basic Rules of Engagement and Escalation When Dealing with Authorities



*Remember: Escalation in this context has no negative connotation: it is not about hostility but about structured enforcement of your rights. Escalation simply means moving the case to the next competent level or body when lower levels fail, and it is a legitimate and often necessary part of good administration.*

### 1. The *When*

Before escalation consider:

- **Contacting Your Europe Advice or a lawyer** **specialised in EU law**:

  Using the legal opinion of professionals is often convincing and may avoid the need for escalation.  This is a proven solution and always advisable.\
  Professionals can also help temper your expectations and point out lawful behaviour that is perceived as unlawful or that is unfair. 

- **Seek informal clarification directly from staff:** \
  Sometimes miscommunication can be resolved at the lowest level without invoking the formal chain. This may save time and preserve working relations. This is a step that can be done over the phone and possibly in parallel to other steps.

- **Request a meeting in person:** \
  if feasible, to resolve issues informally before launching a formal escalation. Face-to-face interactions may reduce misunderstandings and show seriousness. Again, this does not necessarily have to slow down other steps.

- **Interim Measures:**

  In urgent cases, it may be best to seek interim injunctions. These are temporary orders granted by a court or competent authority to prevent irreparable harm while the main case is still pending. In such cases, hiring a lawyer may be imperative.

  - **Examples**: Allowing entry or stay pending a decision, preventing deportation, ordering authorities to issue temporary documents, or suspending an unlawful fee.
  - **Strategic value**: Even if the final case takes months or years, interim measures protect your rights in the meantime and ensure that escalation remains meaningful.

- **Preparing more evidence:**\
  In many cases, the next step of escalation can be strengthened with data obtained from GDPR (regarding your personal data) and Freedom of Information requests (for all other non-personal data).\
  Useful GDPR requests may be: VIS/SIS files, case files \
  Useful FOI requests may be: Internal procedures, guidelines, statistical data on refusals or similar cases, documents on how certain rights are guaranteed.

- **Additional guidance:**

  - **GDPR requests** can also include: records of who accessed your file, correction of inaccurate entries, deletion of unlawfully processed data, and reasons for automated decisions if applicable.
  - **FOI requests** can also include: budgetary or staffing data that show lack of capacity, training materials for staff, audit reports, contracts with external service providers, and correspondence between ministries and subordinate authorities.
  - Requests should be precise but broad enough to avoid denial on grounds of being too narrow or too burdensome.
  - Always ask for documents in their original language and format to prevent selective disclosure.
  - Always ask for documents in digital form, to prevent fees or delays.
  - Failures, missing procedures or incorrect data unveiled by GDPR and FOI requests are separate grounds for escalation.
  - In most cases, at least partial access with redactions is required.

Escalation is necessary when:

- **Deadlines are missed**: Authorities fail to respond within legally prescribed or reasonable time limits. \
  *Deadlines are usually hard limits. They are not targets. Authorities can be reminded of that. Even if deadlines exist, freedom of movement must be guaranteed. If delays impact freedom of movement authorities should be reminded of that.*

- **Rights are denied or ignored**: Clear entitlements under law are disregarded.

- **Unlawful or arbitrary decisions**: Decisions lack legal basis, reasoning, or transparency.

  *One basic principle of EU law is proportionality. This is relevant because any decision by authorities must balance their stated objectives with the impact on individual rights. If a refusal or restriction goes beyond what is necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, it can be challenged as disproportionate, making proportionality a powerful ground for escalation.*  

- **Non-response or obstruction**: Authorities refuse to engage or provide contradictory instructions.

Escalation is optional but often desirable when:

- **Procedural irregularities arise**: Even if not directly unlawful, unclear procedures, shifting requirements, or contradictory instructions warrant escalation.

- **Repeated minor violations occur**: A pattern of small delays, lost documents, or incomplete replies can cumulatively justify escalation.

- **Strategic importance exists**: Escalating early may create pressure or establish precedent in areas where rights are fragile.

- **Transparency is lacking**: When authorities fail to disclose information, explain reasoning, or identify responsible officials, escalation can be used to obtain accountability.

- **Training issues are obvious**: If staff clearly lack knowledge of EU or national law, or demonstrate repeated misunderstandings, escalation may be necessary to reach officials with greater expertise or training responsibility.

### 2. The *How*

Typical escalation follows a step-by-step pattern:

1. **First contact**: Submit a written request or application, ensuring documentation.

   - This step does not require detailed reference to laws unless urgent. 
   - First contact can strategically begin with a simple enquiry.

2. **Reminder or clarification**: If ignored, unclear or not in line with your rights, send a follow-up referencing deadlines and rights.

   - This step helps to maintain a paper trail and puts the authority on notice. As they are informed about what constitutes lawful and unlawful behaviour. If they continue acting unlawfully, it may indicate bad faith.

   - If the previous message was ignored, remind the authority of their duty to reply in reasonable time. Remind them of their duty to guarantee freedom of movement, and explain how the delay has an impact. EU laws and also usually national laws guarantee "good administration". Reference all laws or case law that make ignoring messages unlawful or questionable. \
     Some national laws have the concept of tacit refusal, which makes it formal grounds for escalation.\
     Other member states may use the concept of tacit approval. Make sure you know which concept applies.

   - If the answer was unclear, copy-paste-style-stonewalling or ignoring parts of your enquiry, remind the authority of their duty to give you a meaningful and complete response. EU laws and also usually national laws guarantee "good administration". Reference all laws or case law that make ignoring messages unlawful or questionable. 

   - If the answer is already denying you your rights, ask for the legal basis of their reasoning.\
     Wait for a second response, and analyse it. Assuming that the reasoning is invalid, dissect the reasoning for errors, and state clearly why the refusal is unlawful or disproportionate. Cite the relevant EU and national laws, and request immediate correction. Make clear that unless remedied you will escalate to higher authorities, oversight bodies, or courts.  \
     If urgent, combine the steps do not wait for their legal reasoning.

3. **Internal complaint**: Escalate within the same authority to a supervisor, complaints office, or ombudsman unit.

   - In most cases, we would be dealing with consulates, embassies, border authorities and migration authorities. 
   - For diplomatic missions, the escalation ladder would typically be:

     &#x20;
     - *visa officer / visa section -> head of visa section -> consul general -> embassy / ambassador -> ministry of foreign affairs*
     - or *visa officer / visa section -> head of consular section -> ambassador -> ministry*
     - When writing to any supervisor, address them by name (or title if name is not available).
     - At ministry level, there may be still multiple escalation steps. This may depend on the organisational structure of the ministry. Information about the organisational structure can be requested in separate communication.&#x20;
     - At a certain level, systemic issues are more likely and parallel escalation routes are advisable.
   - For migration authorities, the escalation ladder would typically be:
     - *case officer -> team leader -> head of unit -> regional director -> national migration office director-general -> ministry of interior*
     - At each stage, requests should be addressed formally, and if possible, by name. Again this may depend on the organisational structure of the ministry. Information about the organisational structure can be requested in separate communication.&#x20;
     - And again, at a certain level, systemic issues are more likely and parallel escalation routes are advisable. 
   - Parallel escalation at later stages should include oversight and/or political escalation routes.
   - Ministries often have internal oversight bodies that may be used for escalation like Inspectorate General, Internal Audit Service or similar. Whether these are accessible directly may depend on ministry and EU state. 

4. **External escalation**: If unresolved, move to national oversight bodies, ombudsmen, data protection authority or courts. This is possible regardless of whether it is strictly about national law or also EU law. \
   To strengthen escalation, evidence should be structured carefully. Guidance:

- **Timeline of events**: Prepare a chronological list of all relevant actions, communications, and deadlines. Include exact dates and reference numbers.
- **Annexes with numbering**: Attach each piece of evidence as an annex (Annex 1, Annex 2, etc.) so they can be cited easily in the text.
- **Annex index**: At the start of the bundle, include an index listing each annex with date, title, and short description.
- **Referencing laws and case law**: In your main text, clearly cite EU directives, regulations, and national law. Reference CJEU or ECHR judgments where applicable.
- **Summary page**: Add an executive summary highlighting the breach, why it is unlawful, and what remedy is sought.

This structure makes escalation bundles clear, usable, and persuasive for oversight bodies and courts.

5. **EU-level escalation**: For EU law matters, escalate further to the European Commission, EU Ombudsman, European Parliament or CJEU references (through courts).
   - The first escalation route would always be Solvit. \
     This can be used early in the engagement. You can keep them updated with further communication that you receive from the authority.\
     Keep in mind that Solvit centres are run by national authorities. Solvit usually has very high solution rates but expect timelines stretching weeks to months.
   - The EU ombudsman cannot be contacted directly when you are dealing with national authorities. However, certain national bodies like national ombudsmen or possibly parliaments’ petition committees can forward cases or requests to the European Ombudsman, thereby opening the route indirectly. \
     If you have filed a complaint to the EU commission and are not satisfied, you can also contact the EU ombudsman.
   - A complaint to the EU commission is not a direct route in most cases. Mind that they only pursue complaints that show systemic breach of EU law, and such complaints must normally be framed against a single Member State’s failure to comply with EU law. Try to find others who experience the same issue to file joint complaints or show that the problem is pervasive. The amount of evidence required is much bigger than with a simple administrative complaint to national authorities. It may be strategically wise not to try this without any help.\
     They do sometimes transfer the case to Solvit though, which probably can be powerful if Solvit is not very cooperative.\
     If they do pick up the case, it will not solve anything directly. The aim would be to rectify the systemic breach.  
   - A petition to the European Parliament can be submitted by any EU citizen or resident, individually or jointly with others. \
     Unlike Commission complaints, which deal with systemic breaches of a single member state, including petitions that describe collective failure across multiple member states are possible. It is a way to highlight systemic problems and draw political attention, even if it does not provide a binding decision. Petitions can trigger debates, committee investigations, or requests for the Commission to act, which makes them a useful complementary escalation route.

### Key Principles

- Always maintain a documented paper trail.
- Always demand the legal basis for decisions and reasoning in answers.
- Always back up your own demands with a legal basis.
- Escalation without evidence (dates, references to legal rights, unanswered letters) weakens the case.
- Each escalation should explicitly reference the failure at the previous level.
- Generally, keep communication professional, concise, and grounded in legal reasoning.
  - In urgent cases, however, showing urgency or even sounding desperate can strengthen the record by underlining the seriousness of the matter. 
  - Mind that authorities cannot lawfully use tone against you, and if they attempt to, it may eventually reflect poorly on them, and it is itself grounds for separate escalation.
  - Do always avoid language that could be construed as abusive, insulting, hate speech or personally threatening.
- Where possible, use registered mail, email with delivery confirmation, or other verifiable channels to prove delivery. If emails are not confirmed, escalate this as a separate issue.
- Keep copies of all correspondence and annexes, and consider numbering attachments for easy reference in higher stages of escalation.
- Ensure consistency across all steps: contradictions or omissions can be used against you.
- Mind that recording phone calls may have legal implications or constraints. Make sure you understand these and act lawfully. Third country laws may apply if you are currently outside the EU.
- Always verify and include national laws and/or local laws in your research.
- Avoid unsubstantiated allegations; confine communications to facts, documents, and law.
- Informal routes do not pause statutory appeal or litigation deadlines; file formal remedies within time limits.
- Mind that the scope of this document is limited to official escalation channels. Evidence bundles are meant for competent authorities, oversight bodies, or courts. Publishing in media, websites etc. requires following different rules.
