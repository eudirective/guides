# AI Agents Contribution Guide

**Purpose**
Set non‑negotiable rules for AI agents contributing to this repository. The aim is responsible, verified, and deep research output aligned with the README.

## At a glance (follow in this order)

1. Read `README.md` and any repo conventions before writing.
2. Contribute text only. Do not write code.
3. Verify every legal claim against **primary sources** (EUR‑Lex, official court judgments).
4. Cite precisely: article numbers, case numbers, and official titles. Prefer links to official sources when available.
5. Doubt your first draft. Search at least **two** independent authoritative sources. Note any conflicts.
6. Add context, amendments, exceptions, and edge cases.
7. Separate **fact**, **interpretation**, and **uncertainty**. State your confidence.
8. No fabrication or guesswork. If you cannot verify, say so or omit and report.
9. No personalized legal advice; write informationally and neutrally.
10. Prefer depth and accuracy over speed.

## Scope and role

- This repo focuses on legal guides and analysis. AI agents are language models assisting with text preparation, organization, and drafting only.
- Follow the structure, style, and citation practices described in the README or Contributing docs. When in doubt, mirror existing files.

## Verification (primary‑source first)

- **Must** confirm legal propositions in primary sources: directives, regulations, official guidance, or court decisions.
- Quote sparingly and accurately when wording matters; otherwise paraphrase with an exact citation.
- Provide pinpoint cites (article, paragraph, recital, section).
- Avoid uncited assertions and memory‑based claims. If a primary source cannot be found, use a reputable secondary source and label it **interpretation**.

## Research depth and coverage

- Triangulate across multiple credible sources. Resolve discrepancies or flag them.
- Check scope notes that are often missed: recitals, amendments, repeal/replace provisions, transposition details, temporal application, derogations.
- Consider cross‑instruments and case law that interpret the same provision.
- Record currency: mention if the law was amended, repealed, or is pending application.

## Reasoning and transparency

- Show the short why: reference the controlling text or decision that drives the conclusion.
- Use cautious language where interpretation is involved. Mark unknowns and open questions.
- Do not give individualized compliance instructions. Frame content as information about the law.

## Style and quality

- Formal, neutral tone. Clear structure with short paragraphs, bullets and headings.
- Define abbreviations on first use. Use consistent terminology.
- Proofread names, numbers, and dates. Avoid repetition.
- Do not plagiarize. Synthesize in your own words with citations.
- Keep contributions easy to review: summarize changes and list sources in the PR description.

## Maintenance and review

- Expect human review. Incorporate feedback.
- Update affected pages when a law changes. Prefer incremental, well‑scoped edits.
- If guidance here conflicts with the README, raise it in a PR and follow the stricter rule until resolved.

**Core principle:** Double‑check, cite, and explain. When sources or inference points are limited, research further or state the uncertainty plainly.
